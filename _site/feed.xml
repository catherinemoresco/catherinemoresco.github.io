        <title>Pirate like it&#39;s 1989: Why Taylor Swift is not the Music Industry</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me put this out there, first: I genuinely like Taylor Swift. I really do. I have nothing but admiration for the way that she&amp;#39;s matured as a musician. She seems funny, and smart, and sweet. And her style, &lt;em&gt;oh my god&lt;/em&gt;, I can&amp;#39;t tell whether I have watched the music video for &amp;quot;Blank Space&amp;quot; around 300 times because of the catchy tune, or because Swift just looks &lt;em&gt;so on point&lt;/em&gt; in her lingerie and refined gowns and riding outfit (and that lipstick!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I will not buy her album. And I am skeptical about whether her bold move of removing her music from Spotify will usher in a new-old era of rushing to Target to buy CDs, felling that music-streaming giant in the process (if anything is to be responsible for that, it&amp;#39;s more likely to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/business/media/youtube-introduces-a-paid-service-called-music-key.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;Youtube&amp;#39;s new streaming service&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of reasons that I think this is the case. Lots of arguments have been made about how the system that Swift is trying to reinstate can never work as long as piracy is possible (and easy to do), and Daniel Ek himself, CEO of Spotify, wrote a passionate &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.spotify.com/se/2014/11/11/2-billion-and-counting/&quot;&gt;defense of his company&amp;#39;s business model&lt;/a&gt;. He argues (quite convincingly, I think), that music streaming services are a niche in which the music industry can survive, in a world where the only barrier standing between a listener and a free album is a few seconds of Googling, a few minutes of downloading, and perhaps a momentary twinge of conscience--if that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#39;t think that Ek has much to fear, and I feel that the oversight that a lot of people are making is summed up nicely by the Bloomberg Businessweek cover below...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2014-11-16/TSwift_cover.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, &lt;em&gt;Taylor Swift is not the music indusry&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She goes on talking about what she has &amp;quot;proved&amp;quot;, that &amp;quot;music has value&amp;quot; and that she sincerely hopes artists won&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;undervalue their art&amp;quot;. But, if she&amp;#39;s hoping for a revolution, she is being blind to the fact that &lt;em&gt;the average musician cannot do what she just did.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taylor Swift is the exception, not the rule. In addition to being a gorgeous, lovable girl with some vocal chords that belong on some sort of pop-star angel, she (or her marketing team, whichever) is an incredible businesswoman, and has managed to build a fanbase that is not rivaled by many. In a time when even other big-name artists like Lady Gaga struggle to sell albums, demand for Taylor&amp;#39;s have always been high. Her last album, &lt;em&gt;Red&lt;/em&gt;, was the fastest-selling album in over a decade, even without the media-grabbing Spotify-snubbing that has earned &lt;em&gt;1989&lt;/em&gt; so much press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is, her album&amp;#39;s success, and her astronomical profits from it, are not a result of her splitting from Spotify, and perhaps not even from any value inherent in her art itself, but rather the value of the name and the brand she had already built and the throngs of fans over which she rules. And--though I like Taylor Swift, and I listen to her songs, and I lose no respect for her adorers--her headline-making move strikes me not as an industry leader helping others take a stand for their own artistic value, but rather the arrogant top player of a very difficult game blazing trails where others cannot follow. If a less well-known artist does not allow their listeners to hear their music on Spotify, they will not sell 1.2 million albums in their first week; &lt;em&gt;their music will just not be heard.&lt;/em&gt; (Or it will be pirated.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spotify emerged in response to a problem--declining album sales in the face of growing internet piracy. That problem is not going to go away, even in the face of Swift&amp;#39;s artistic ideals. It worked this time. It worked for her. But in the long-term, it will take more than this to uproot music streaming.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teaching my Computer to Read, Part 1: PDFs are Evil</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My favorite computer science classes are the ones that let you build whatever you want. My Introduction to Programming class consisted of a class wiki with student-posted problems, that you could complete whenever you wanted, however you wanted, in whatever language you wanted. It was awesome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My class this quarter, Software Construction, has a similar setup, though slightly more structured; working in teams of six, we get to present a proposal, complete with UML use case, class, and activity diagrams, and then implement it and test it rigorously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoy messing around with computer vision (that is, after all, why I &lt;a href=&quot;http://catherinemoresco.github.io/projects/&quot;&gt;taught my fish to play Pokemon that one time&lt;/a&gt;), so I decided to do a project that would involve some sweet OpenCV action.
 I also had a lot of readings to do for my philosophy class. Most of these were PDFs of poorly scanned documents. Even when the text lines were miraculously not affected by page curvature, they were often skewed. This is fine for reading, but since they&amp;#39;re just scans they can&amp;#39;t be highlighted in Preview for Mac, so I always have to resort to awkwardly drawing straight boxes around my skewed areas of interest, or spending minutes drawing individual lines under whole paragraphs and minutes more making them consistent in length and width.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2014-11-13/Nonideal_page.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2014-11-13/Nonideal_boxed.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2014-11-13/Nonideal_underlined.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How hard could it be,&lt;/em&gt; I thought, &lt;em&gt;to detect the lines and draw the highlights on myself?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in the meantime, split pages in which there are two book-pages per PDF-page? And maybe rotate the pages ever-so-slightly so that they&amp;#39;re straight again? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so my project was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t about teaching my computer to read, so much as to teach it the small accessory functions to reading, like straightening a page or laying it flat, without having to go through the trouble of OCR-ing the whole damn thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first issue, through, was that image processing techniques are (tautologically) meant to process images, and PDFs are not images. In the moment of optimisim upon my conception of the project, this struck me as a trivial problem. After all, scans are just images, right? It can&amp;#39;t be that hard to extract them from their barely-there PDF shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except it can. Taking apart PDFs is hard. Extracting JPGs from PDFs &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be easy (for example, take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200712/extracting_jpgs_from_pdfs.html&quot;&gt;Ned Batchelder&amp;#39;s code snippet&lt;/a&gt; that accomplishes this in 20-ish lines of Python), but it can also be hard. As I discovered when I tried to run that same snippet on a few different documents and, to my horror, discovered that there are some images it just doesn&amp;#39;t pick up on. It was then, and only then, (after I had gotten my project proposal approved and convinced some poor souls to hop on board with me) that I stumbled upon this &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.idrsolutions.com/2010/04/understanding-the-pdf-file-format-how-are-images-stored/&quot;&gt;lovely soul-crushing article&lt;/a&gt;, that kindly broke the news that &amp;quot;if you want to extract images from a PDF, you need to assemble the image from all the raw data â€“ it is not stored as a complete image file you can just rip out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are PDF rendering libraries out there. I spent about eight hours researching them and then four trying to get the one that I decided on, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imagemagick.org/&quot;&gt;ImageMagick&lt;/a&gt;, installed properly. That adds up to about twelve hours of seriously considering renaming our endeavor from &amp;quot;The PDF Project&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Who Needs PDFs Anyway&amp;quot;, and pivoting to work exclusively with tried and true image formats: JPG, PNG. Old friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So...ta-dah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;extractImages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;images&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pdf_im&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PyPDF2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PdfFileReader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;npage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pdf_im&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getNumPages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;npage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PythonMagick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;blob&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PythonMagick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Blob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;density&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;75&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;## read in pdf&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;[&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;]&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 

            &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;## write to buffer&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;blob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;RGB&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rawdata&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;base64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b64decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;blob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;base64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;## convert raw data to np array&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ndarray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dtype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;uint16&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;buffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rawdata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;images&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s simple, and slow, and a little ugly, and it brings another third-party dependency into our cobbled-together little app, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s my punishment for not doing my research and fully expecting to be able to build a PDF renderer in a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesson learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next Time: Skew detection!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On improving</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perfectionism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been &amp;quot;good at school&amp;quot;. This isn&amp;#39;t an indicator of genius, but rather one of being quite suited to a system that is very rewarding (and perhaps demanding) of being a perfectionist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s good and bad. On the one hand, I&amp;#39;m very self-motivated! On the other, when it comes to process that are inherently incremental and reliant upon continuously learning--like, you know, &lt;em&gt;practically everything in the real world&lt;/em&gt;--I sometimes get uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schoolwork is extremely modular. You work on a project, you submit it, you get a grade, you move on. You take a test, you submit it, you get a grade, you move on. So, when you walk into that test or sit down to work on that project, there&amp;#39;s an immense amount of pressure to do it right the first time, make it as complete and thorough and perfect as you can, and submit it only when you&amp;#39;re ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real life isn&amp;#39;t so climactic. For example, this website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of my summer builing and rebuilding my website--trying to perfect it, trying to figure out which fonts truly &lt;em&gt;embody&lt;/em&gt; my &lt;em&gt;soul&lt;/em&gt; (Raleway won out, but Open Sans will forever be dear to me) and painstakingly adjusting a color scheme, only to then decide that what I had constructed wasn&amp;#39;t perfect, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I realized that I was getting absolutely nowhere. This isn&amp;#39;t a marriage proposal or a down payment on a house, it&amp;#39;s a website. It can change. It can be imperfect, and the journey starting from its imperfections can (and hopefully will) be a valuable one. This scripty font? &lt;em&gt;Why not?&lt;/em&gt; Navy blue? &lt;em&gt;Sure&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Also, I started applying for jobs, and my old website was pretty mediocre, so, you know. Pressure.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here it is: my blog. It&amp;#39;s imperfect, and it&amp;#39;s under construction...and I hope it will be that way for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
