<p>
I am a third-year student at the <a href="http://uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a>.

<br><br>
I'm most well known for <a href="/projects/">teaching my fish to play Pokemon</a>, but I also have done work to develop an <a href="/projects">app</a> to help students with dietary restrictions at my university's dining hall figure out what they can and can't eat.
<br><br>
I spent my past summer as a <a href="http://hackny.org/a/">HackNY</a> Fellow at <a href="http://hioscar.com">Oscar Health</a>, doing data science and visualization and developing internal tools for contract analytics.
<br><br>
I study Physics and Computer Science, and I'm passionate about learning about the world and building things to allow interaction with it in new and exciting ways.
