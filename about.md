<p>
'm a software engineer at <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>, and an alumna of the  <a href="http://uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a>.
<br><br>
I study Physics and Computer Science, and I'm passionate about learning about the world and building things to allow interaction with it in new and exciting ways. My professional work has ranged from training acoustic models for speech recognition systems to end-to-end feature development in Google Search.

<br><br>
I'm most well known for <a href="/projects/#fpp">teaching my fish to play Pokemon</a>, but I also have done work to develop an <a href="/projects/#feedme">app</a> to help students with dietary restrictions at my university's dining hall figure out what they can and can't eat, a <a href="/projects/#scannd">computer-vision-powered web-based PDF reader</a>, and a <a href="/projects/#bees">homepage for bee-lovers</a>.
<br><br>
I've also worked at <a href="http://www.appnexus.com/">AppNexus</a>, working on algorithmic optimization of their real-time bidding software in the online advertising performance marketplace, and I was a  <a href="http://hackny.org/a/">HackNY</a> Fellow at <a href="http://hioscar.com">Oscar Health</a>, doing data science and visualization and developing internal tools for contract analytics.
