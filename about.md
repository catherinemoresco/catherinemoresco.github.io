<p>
I am a senior at the <a href="http://uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a>, and soon-to-be engineering resident at <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>.
<br><br>
I study Physics and Computer Science, and I'm passionate about learning about the world and building things to allow interaction with it in new and exciting ways.


<br><br>
I'm most well known for <a href="/projects/#fpp">teaching my fish to play Pokemon</a>, but I also have done work to develop an <a href="/projects/#feedme">app</a> to help students with dietary restrictions at my university's dining hall figure out what they can and can't eat, a <a href="/projects/#scannd">computer-vision-powered web-based PDF reader</a>, and a <a href="/projects/#bees">homepage for bee-lovers</a>.
<br><br>
I spent the past summer at <a href="http://www.appnexus.com/">AppNexus</a>, working on algorithmic optimization of their real-time bidding software in the online advertising performance marketplace.
 <br><br>
I spent the summer of 2014 as a <a href="http://hackny.org/a/">HackNY</a> Fellow at <a href="http://hioscar.com">Oscar Health</a>, doing data science and visualization and developing internal tools for contract analytics.
