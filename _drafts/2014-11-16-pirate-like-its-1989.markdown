Let me put this out there, first: I genuinely like Taylor Swift. I really do. I have nothing but admiration for the way that she's matured as a musician. She seems funny, and smart, and sweet. And her style, *oh my god*, I can't tell whether I have watched the music video for "Blank Space" around 300 times because of the catchy tune, or because Swift just looks *so on point* in her lingerie and refined gowns and riding outfit (and that lipstick!).


But, I will not buy her album. And I am skeptical about whether her bold move of removing her music from Spotify will usher in a new-old era of rushing to Target to buy CDs, felling that music-streaming giant in the process (if anything is to be responsible for that, it's more likely to be [Youtube's new streaming service](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/business/media/youtube-introduces-a-paid-service-called-music-key.html?_r=0)). 

There are a lot of reasons that I think this is the case. Lots of arguments have been made about how the system that Swift is trying to reinstate can never work as long as piracy is possible (and easy to do), and Daniel Ek himself, CEO of Spotify, wrote a passionate [defense of his company's business model](https://news.spotify.com/se/2014/11/11/2-billion-and-counting/). He argues (quite convincingly, I think), that music streaming services are a niche in which the music industry can survive, in a world where the only barrier standing between a listener and a free album is a few seconds of Googling, a few minutes of downloading, and perhaps a momentary twinge of conscience--if that.

But I don't think that Ek has much to fear, and I feel that the oversight that a lot of people are making is summed up nicely by the Bloomberg Businessweek cover below...

That is, *Taylor Swift is not the music indusry*. 

She goes on talking about what she has "proved", that "music has value" and that she sincerely hopes artists won't "undervalue their art". But, if she's hoping for a revolution, she is being blind to the fact that *the average musician cannot do what she just did.*

Taylor Swift is the exception, not the rule. In addition to being a gorgeous, lovable girl with some vocal chords that belong on some sort of pop-star angel, she (or her marketing team, whichever) is an incredible businesswoman, and has managed to build a fanbase that is not rivaled by many. In a time when even other big-name artists like Lady Gaga struggle to sell albums, demand for Taylor's have always been high. Her last album, *Red*, was the fastest-selling album in over a decade, even without the media-grabbing Spotify-snubbing that has earned *1989* so much press.

The fact is, her album's success, and her astronomical profits from it, are not a result of her splitting from Spotify, and perhaps not even from any value inherent in her art itself, but rather the value of the name and the brand she had already built and the throngs of fans over which she rules. And--though I like Taylor Swift, and I listen to her songs, and I lose no respect for her adorers--her headline-making move strikes me not as an industry leader helping others take a stand for their own artistic value, but rather the arrogant top player of a very difficult game blazing trails where others cannot follow. If a less well-known artist does not allow their listeners to hear their music on Spotify, they will not sell 1.2 million albums in their first week; *their music will just not be heard.* (Or it will be pirated.)

Spotify emerged in response to a problem--declining album sales in the face of growing internet piracy. That problem is not going to go away, even in the face of Swift's artistic ideals. It worked this time. It worked for her. But in the long-term, it will take more than this to uproot music streaming.
