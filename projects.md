# Fish Plays Pokemon
<img src="/img/fpp1.jpg" style="height: 300px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block"/>

A collaboration with <a href="http://pfacheris.github.io/">Patrick Facheris</a> in which we "taught" our pet fish to play Pokemon by writing a motion tracker in Python and OpenCV to trace his movements around his tank. The project was featured on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2014/08/08/20000-people-are-watching-a-fish-play-pokemon/">Forbes</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28704028">BBC</a>, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/07/watch-this-actual-real-life-fish-play-pokemon-albeit-poorly/">TechCrunch</a>, and I was interviewed by <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/an-exclusive-interview-with-the-fish-playing-pokemon">Vice</a> and <a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/08/13/twitch-fish-play-pokemon-twitch-python-programmers">ReadWrite</a>.
