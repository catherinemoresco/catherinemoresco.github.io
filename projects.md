# Fish Plays Pokemon
<img src="/img/fpp1.jpg" style="width: 400px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block"/>

A collaboration with <a href="http://pfacheris.github.io/">Patrick Facheris</a> in which we "taught" our pet fish to play Pokemon by writing a motion tracker in Python and OpenCV to trace his movements around his tank. The project was featured on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2014/08/08/20000-people-are-watching-a-fish-play-pokemon/">Forbes</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28704028">BBC</a>, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/07/watch-this-actual-real-life-fish-play-pokemon-albeit-poorly/">TechCrunch</a>, and I was interviewed by <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/an-exclusive-interview-with-the-fish-playing-pokemon">Vice</a> and <a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/08/13/twitch-fish-play-pokemon-twitch-python-programmers">ReadWrite</a>.

We also built an API, and were featured API sponsors of the Fall 2014 HackNY Hackathon.

A research project to explore the use of acoustic multilateration to pinpoint the location of a noise source in space, using a set of readily available acoustic sensors--iPhones. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fT6lRtWwRw_d61L8Mf-ZOQn21SG22Hhw3-Br8QzY0Yc/edit?usp=sharing">Design Doc,</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FZ5YcVhvqnIH1dLDFh7TJK_JnymzUvS5UuRBSeEC2Dw/edit?usp=sharing">Slides<a>

# Scannd: The PDF Project
<img src="/img/pdf1.png" style="width: 400px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block"/>

A web-based PDF viewer that not only displays your document, but will also automatically fix skew and allow for drawing of highlights on on text lines. It is intended for use with scanned images, where the page is represented as an image instead of text, but where using OCR would be needlessly expensive and time-consuming. I've written several <a href="/blog">blog posts</a> about the process and mathematical techniques discovered and used throughout the various stages of product development. Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/catherinemoresco/PDFProject">GitHub</a>!

# Bee News!
<img src="/img/bee1.png" style="width: 400px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block"/>

A very simple app that scrapes Google News for the latest news about bees, and then repackages it into a nice little bee-themed page. Why? I just have a lot of friends that like bees. Also, bee news tends to have some great headlines.
