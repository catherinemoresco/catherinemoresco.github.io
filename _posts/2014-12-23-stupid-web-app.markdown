[Bee News](http://beenews.co.uk/) is a stupid web app that I made. There's nothing technically challenging or novel about it. And I absolutey *love* it.

If you don't feel like checking out the repo yourself, the tl;dr is this: Bee News is a web scraper that takes the first page of a Google News search for "bees" and repackages it into a (rather aesthetically pleasing, if I do say so myself) bee-themed page. The technical side isn't particularly interesting--the actual scraping is less than 10 lines of BeautifulSoup, and the entire thing is just a tiny Flask app because Flask is an easy and fun and comfortable thing for me to use. 

So why is it one of my favorite projects? There are a few reasons, actually--it's funny; it's well-loved (with a sparse but cherished ~200 views per month); and, even though from a coding persepctive it is not technically interesting, it has still been a project that has taught me a lot.

#### Using Flask-Cache

#### Parallax scrolling is easy
